Generative Pre-trained Transformer that communicates with a user through a web-based interface. The goal was to create something akin to chatGPT.
Navigate to the server folder and run (node server.js) to initialize the the web-server and training process. When the training process has finished
the user can send a message through the web-interface, which the GPT will use as a basis for generating output. 

To utilize as training data, place any .txt file inside the same folder as gpt.py. Keep in mind that the length of the training process depends on the capability of your machine and the training data that is used.
